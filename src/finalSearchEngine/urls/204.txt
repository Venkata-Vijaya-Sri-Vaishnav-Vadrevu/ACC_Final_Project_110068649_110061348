The elastic strap on one of them was broken when I received it. There was only 1 SD card in 2 bundles but I am using larger SD cards anyway. I ended up getting a different case to hold the drone, controller and batteries, which have special slots for each and a flip up top. The backpack in this bundle is good for carrying other accessories. The Mavic Air 2 is a very stable drone, easy to fly with some great safety features. It has a nice camera for daytime video and photos. It's not that great for nighttime shots but I don't plan on using it at night anyway. The Fly More combo is a great value as each battery costs around $115 when you purchase spares so that alone makes it a savings over getting just the drone with 1 battery bundle. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: buydig (18) (0) by jofara0 Jun 06, 2020 It rocks ! Best drone I have ever owned! makes the others look weak compared to it ; fly's by itself and I have learned to trust it to film other lessor drones because I can trust it to stay where I put it even in some what windy conditions. The range and single strength out does all my other drones too. In some ways its like a machine, boring in some regards because it really does fly it self, unlike one of my drones that if you take you eye off of it too long you got to wounder if its wounding off into a build or tree- The air stays where you leave her until the battery goes low or you give it a command; out of all my drones (3) the Air has the best flight time, best camera, best features. Will be buying another one really soon too. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: djiofficialstore (31) (0) by tremont.rc Feb 05, 2021 Great for first time users! From someone who has always loved photography, but never owned a drone; this is definitely one of the coolest "flying cameras" you can get. Anti-collision sensors, extra propellers, a charging station for everything, ND filters, and enough batteries for a flight time of about 75 to 85 minutes total before needing to head back to the charging station with your 3 batteries. I was also amazed how well this drone handles wind; and the ability to fly miles away with it! X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: techindiscount (19) (1) by mojo1094 Mar 24, 2021 Fantastic value, fantastic UAV This is a fantastic UAV, and the Fly More kit is essential if only for the batteries alone. The flying experience is top notch and as user friendly as it can be. Even in strong winds this powerful aircraft stays steady. The camera is wonderful and takes great pictures, especially for the size. You are here because you have done some reading and probably already know a lot about it, rest assured it lives up to the hype. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: dronesuperstore (14) (0) by anteaterman4 Feb 08, 2021 Great Drone Tech, not many issues to speak of This is a great piece of technology and an awesome upgrade by DJI in its drone fleet! It's smaller, still retains Mavic Pro's wind resistance, and has plenty of new features! Only issue would be no sensors on the top or sides of the drone...
