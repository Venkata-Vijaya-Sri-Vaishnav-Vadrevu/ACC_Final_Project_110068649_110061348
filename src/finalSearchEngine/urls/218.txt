I have to overspray to get slightly better projection, but even then it quickly becomes a skin scent, Im not sure if this has been reformulated but it certainly does not live up to its youtube reputation! X Previous image Next image (12) (1) by crob9808 Jun 18, 2018 Top critical review Dont buy Way too strong and smells cheap. If you spray one spray on you, you will be hoping it goes away but ironically it actually lasts all day. Its not one of those colognes that smells too strong at first and settles down it just obnoxious and makes you want to choke all day. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: worldwideperfum... (10) (18) by triumph*cat Mar 10, 2021 Versatile and Compliments For me, Eros EDT is extremely versatile and the correct strength. 4 sprays in warm weather and 5 in the cold. I like the EDP as well but find that to be more of a night or cold weather fragrance. I will probably use about half of the EDT bottle this summer. Good compliments.
