I wanted a simple Android tablet with GPS capabilities for off-road mapping applications in my side-by-side. This Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 fits the bill well. The large screen is visible enough to see in daylight (although colors are muted and contrast is lacking) and the storage capacity allows for downloading maps for use later without an internet connection. The processor and RAM is up to the task of handling the single mapping application smoothly and the GPS chipset has worked flawlessly thus far. (for regular tablet use, it’s laggy & not super smooth) So, if you are looking for an inexpensive Android tablet, this model works ok. For my single focus need, it works great. But, if you really want a superior tablet experience a much better screen, and buttery smooth performance, buy an iPad!

(7) (0) by shawndrone Jul 06, 2021 Top critical review Very disappointed. two or three videos and battery needs charging ads are consuming more processing power than what I am. Nagging upgrades you can't turn off or turn down. If it works just fine why would I need to upgrade? No usefull settings for personalization. Can't turn off anything advertisement. Still only runs half day Before needing charge. Mild use. Better sound than my tab A but at a cost of battery life. Every time I had to upgrade my tab A battery life got worse. And got more ads. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: preownedtech (1) (7) by bestofthebest14 Aug 02, 2021 Features and Color are very good. I liked the tablet very much. The color is great and good battery life. The door to put the SD card in was very difficult to open. I needed to use a broken paperclip to open the door. There has got to be a better way to do this. That's the only thing I have to complain about it. Very good price too.

(2) (1) by riverand-30 Jul 26, 2021 Another Super Samsung Galaxy Product I have had great luck with Samsung Galaxy products, so I thought I would try out this Tablet. I am very happy with the deal, and my purchase. The tablet is a nice size, has great picture, super sound, runs off wifi, and if you don't like 32 or 64gb micro SD card, purchase a bigger size. I like it, no complaints. Easy to use, works great. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: quickshipelectr... (4) (0) by bwom1053 Nov 08, 2021 Fast to touch response tablet with plenty of storage space to expand. Awsome tablet. I needed to replace my older samsung tablet as it was well used and started to have issues although 5 ys of use constantly. This tablet is fast and have more storage of 64GB with a micro SD card of 64 GB, so I have plenty of storage for what i'll be using this tablet for. The response touch time is fast and speed of connection to the internet is great. Overall i'm pleased with this purchase since I purchased it as an open box item for a fraction of the retail price. Another great product. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: quickshipelectr... (0) (0) Why is this review inappropriate?
