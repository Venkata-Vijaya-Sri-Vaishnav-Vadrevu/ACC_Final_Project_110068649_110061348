Positive feedback by l***s During past month A+++ Positive feedback by w***0 During past month Ordered after work on 11/23, item arrived on 11/27 - that is super impressive! Very fast. Item is brand new in box - have not tried it yet as it is a Christmas gift. Positive feedback by s***_ During past month as detailed Positive feedback by 1***s During past month 100% Satisfaction. Excellent Seller. Highly Recommended. A+++++ Positive feedback by a***p During past month Perfect! Thank you! Positive feedback by 2***a During past month Great to buy from! Item arrived early, and in great condition. Positive feedback by e***d During past month Arrived early! Sealed and a console I can뭪 find in stores. Thank you? Positive feedback by n***d During past month A+ seller, good description, fast shipping. Would buy from again. Neutral feedback by i***o During past 6 months Buying from a scalper is never ideal but with a lack of information from Nintendo regarding restock dates there weren뭪 many other options. Luckily this scalper wasn뭪 too unreasonable with prices and it was listed only $50 dollars more than retail. That being said my product arrived broken. I don뭪 believe this was the fault of the seller because the box appeared unopened with all original pieces inside. Despite buying from eBay, I was still able to claim my warranty so it all worked out.

Got it way ahead of schedule which was awesome because I was worried it was going to arrive after the birthday. Everything is in perfect working order. Brand new, just started playing, but it's fun, sleek and has an adorable design. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: premium-japan (7) (3) by meby-7572 Jan 28, 2021 Nintendo Animal Crossing Switch Everything came as promised. The switch was already charged and ready to be set up. I was hesitant to buy used, but due to the price and the other reviews I made the purchase. It is even better than I expected. There is only one mark on one of the joycons, but other than that it looks brand new. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: discount.tech (4) (0) by ruah_piskonit Jun 01, 2020 Great design! Love this switch! Honestly an amazing product all around. For first time switch buyers, it is a must if you love Animal Crossing. Beware - many games, including New Horizons do NOT transfer your save between systems, nor do they support the cloud. Who knows why!? So if you뭨e picking this up, don뭪 bother with the tablet (no one inspects the back very often anyway). Enjoy!! Nintendo should consider just selling joycons/dock bundles themselves.

So much fun for the kids........and adults. The graphics look great, and so cool to play on TV or go portable .....easily. Love that there are lots of kid friendly games. Easy to recharge on the dock, and love how quickly it turns on and off.....so fast compared to PS4. Overall seems very organized and easy to use and real kid friendly. If you don뭪 own one, gotta get this. You뭠l be happy you did, (even if you don뭪 have kids, lol) X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: pre-owned | Sold by: upnorthphones (1) (0) by alvakend Jul 31, 2020 Excellent purchase!! 2 hours on the island! You can take as many trips as needed; learn all the diy you want; fill your pockets up with materials, special items, art, fish, bugs, catalog things, whatever you뭭e seen in the game- it뭩 on this island. Trust me. Super organized as well so it makes your trips easy! I뭢 so excited to have done this and can뭪 wait to get back and start rearranging things on my own island win all Of my new loot!
