It is for light duty, but this little 10" electric chainsaw is pretty good. It does get heavy when on the pole and it is extended al the way, but much better than having to saw through the branches by hand. It can tackle some pretty thick branches, too. Being electric, you are dependent on a power source, but that was no surprise...it says "Electric" in the title. Overall it is a good product for light yard word. I wish they sold pole replacement parts, though. If something breaks, you have to buy a whole new pole.

The side motor make hard to Trimming & Pruning because you can not get the saw inside the tree, I don't know because of me or the chain saw not sharp when pruning i tear up the tree. Beside all that the saw do a good job for lower cutting. Sorry for my English X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: cpo-outlets (9) (4) by moosekebear Feb 01, 2017 great for round the house trimming I can never get gas power chain saws to start being a not so strong woman. This is great for trimming shrubs and low lying limbs, but I cannot trim my tall crepe myrtles without assistance with the extension . It was just too heavy for me to handle. But it works really well. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: worxgt (6) (0) by c_almeida1 Aug 03, 2017 Chain saw for home This is a descent product like most WORX products, it is not meant for any major work, but to do work around the city homes. Cutting down small branches and trees. It would not be able to cut down a larger tree as it is only 10" long. It is good to have around the house as it does have the ability to trim trees that would be difficult to cut with a hand saw or other tools. There are lots of cautions with using this tool as it can cause severe damage if misused or used carelessly. Always review the online videos on safety as this can be a life saver. The extension pole is a convenience but having a dangerous tools like this attached to the extension pole can make the tool even more dangerous as it can get difficult to manage the weight of the tool and the pole at some angles. The tool appears to be strong enough for most tasks. Not sure if replacement parts are available as I have not been able to find a replacement blade for this saw. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: worxgt (5) (1) by a1qualityproducts Nov 16, 2016 Great chain saw with long extension handle. Used this saw off the back of a trailer running off a generator while trimming tree limbs along farm fields. I was very impressed with the power it had and the length of the handle. With handle fully extended it is quite heavy but it does reach very high. The neat thing about this saw is that it can be used with the extension handle or it can be used as a regular saw without the long handle. Very versatile. I would buy it again.
