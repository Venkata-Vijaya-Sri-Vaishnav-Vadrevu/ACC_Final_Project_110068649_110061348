Feedback on Bose from others who bought this item 350 Positive 3 Neutral 2 Negative Positive feedback by r***e During past month Fast shipping, great transaction! Positive feedback by r***o During past month Great seller Positive feedback by r***y During past month Nothing like a Bose. Already have one and order this one for my daughter for Christmas. Positive feedback by b***2 During past month Will contact seller .And if you ca also help with this Thanks Positive feedback by _***c During past month This is great and delivered ahead of schedule! Thank you very much! Positive feedback by o***o During past month Thanks! Positive feedback by d***d During past month I am very happy with my purchase, thank you! Positive feedback by h***c During past month Excellent thank you ? Positive feedback by s***s During past month Great packaging and service. The products works very well, as expected. Positive feedback by h***s During past month Fast handling and shipping; well packaged. Neutral feedback by f***h During past month It’s important to watch closely as the price of refurbished items goes down fast at times. I wasn’t so lucky. Negative feedback by a***o During past 6 months Bought a set of refurbished Bose 700 ANC headphones. One of the ear cups was broken. I first wasted a bunch of time trying to get help from bose support and square trade/allstate. Eventually bose ebay people agreed to send me a replacement but its going to take 3+ weeks. Absolutely ridiculous. If I wanted the headset in 3 weeks time I would have bought it then. Neutral feedback by h***g During past 6 months We had distortion in our headphones that could not be diagnosed on the phone. Bose offered to replace them, but it's been almost a month since we mailed them to Bose. Poor communication on their part. They get a positive for their product but a negative for follow-up. Result: Neutral. Neutral feedback by m***7 During past year did you receive the item Negative feedback by r***i During past year THE SELLER FORGOT TO ADD THE SUITE ADDRESS SO IT GOT "LOST" WITH UPS!
