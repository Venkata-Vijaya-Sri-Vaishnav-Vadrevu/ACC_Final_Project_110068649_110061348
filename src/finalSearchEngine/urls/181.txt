Very happy! Dewalt 20V MAX BL............How can you go wrong with Dewalt?! The answer is that you can't! I did the research on the top rated Drills and Dewalt ranks very high! I'd had the same old Panasonic drill for over 10 years. I'm getting older so trying to wrap my kid size (and arthritic) hands around that 3 inch square battery was getting tougher and tougher! I love the easy on/off battery pack on this drill! I've used it for over 6 hours and I'm still seeing a good charge remaining. It came with two battery packs so I have the spare precharged and on stand-by when that time comes! I love it! The price was very reasonable, especially the free shipping! I definitely recommend this product! X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: cpo-outlets (0) (0) by ralank_82 May 21, 2020 Powerful drill. Great drill. Built a grapevine trellis using 2x4's screwed to 4x4's. The drill was more than powerful enough to drive the 3-1/2" self drilling deck screws. I drove about 60 screws and had to switch batteries after about 40 or so. When tightening the bit into the chuck you have to be careful not to run the drill too fast and long, or it can burn your hand. I learned to slowly tighten the chuck until it clicks and that indicates the bit is secure. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: cpo-outlets (3) (0) by danejaca May 21, 2020 Light weight with great features. Compact, light weight and a very good choice for around the home but also for more demanding work. Only gave it 4 stars because this model doesn't have a battery charge indicator light (?). Like that the 20v system allows the use of other larger DeWalt batteries for longer power times if needed although the two batteries it comes with should provide considerable work time. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: cpo-outlets (0) (0) by dada_8694 Feb 10, 2021 Worth a hundred bucks. Bought this very light weight 20 V battery powered drill as a replacement for my old 14.4 V Black & Decker I wasn't interested at the almost $200.00 price, but "on sale" closer to one hundred yes. No comparison to power or weight to my old drill. I would recommend.. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: cpo-outlets (0) (0) by woody2lne Jan 04, 2021 Handy and Good Value DeWalt compact cordless drills are very handy and easier to carry than the larger cordless ones, especially using the smaller capacity batteries. Good value as well. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: cpo-outlets (0) (0) Why is this review inappropriate?
