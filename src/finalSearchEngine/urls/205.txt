Negative feedback by p***d During past month if you are outside US don't buy it. I bought one set and the battery is bad, when I contact to the seller he said that I had to return it, but I too expensive to do it, now don't have my money and don't have a functional headset. Negative feedback by f***2 During past month Somehow wound up buying two pairs of these. Only a week after using the one pair, its right earbud just doesn't charge anymore. I've tried it with both sets' charging cases- the bud is irresponsive, does not glow to indicate it is charging and does not turn on when out of the case. I have not dropped or damaged these earbuds in any way beforehand. I also know that refurbished does not = perfect, problems may still happen. At least I have the second pair for now, if they will last any longer. Negative feedback by h***i During past month el producto llegó bien embalado, pero el al probarlos el audífonos izquierdo se escucha distorsionado, se sube y baja el volumen. no puedo usarlo pido mi devolución. Neutral feedback by 0***3 During past 6 months Don't understand Why when I buy these headphones they work a few days and now one of them don't. For example , When I listen to both of them It only works on one headphone . Can someone please tell me That's a pair of this malfunction on my headphones. Neutral feedback by e***5 During past 6 months Appreciate the business thank you Negative feedback by u***- During past 6 months I'm so sad I always wanted wireless earbuds. The right earbud pairs good but the left keep blinking blue and doesn't play sound I reset them but they still do the same thing. Negative feedback by d***i During past 6 months arrived safely. but a headset does not work, it downloads very fast in 1 minute unfortunately Negative feedback by o***o During past 6 months uno de los audífonos no funciona.. Neutral feedback by c***1 During past 6 months Very sensitive to water. This is my third pair, my first pair I left in my pocket when I did laundry. My second pair of these didn’t sync properly, and my third (current) I water damaged yesterday while doing dishes just by pushing them into my ear a smidge. The sound quality is fantastic though, you can feel the bass through your body sometimes it’s great. I might get another pair but… idk Neutral feedback by m***s During past 6 months The headphones dont work…. Showed up well packaged but they literally do not pair. Negative feedback by t***. During past 6 months they worked fine at first now they keep breaking up and when using during a call the other person is unable to hear me at times. I purchased 3 pairs and they've both done this. I'm not understanding. 1st pair were returned I'm not sure what is happening. Neutral feedback by t***. During past 6 months they worked fine at first now they keep breaking up and when using during a call the other person is unable to hear me at times. I purchased 2 pairs and they've both done this. I'm not understanding. Negative feedback by 0***2 During past 6 months I know it says refurbished but when I got them only one of them worked ?? Neutral feedback by b***9 During past 6 months great price fast shipping. Battery life in right ear piece is maybe 1.5 hours tops. Something is wrong with it. Negative feedback by c***c During past 6 months why do you have button's?!?! Neutral feedback by c***1 During past 6 months Earbuds did not pair to each other. Seller offered me a refund immediately. I have bought earbuds from this seller before and they were fantastic... but I left those in my pocket when I washed my clothes. Try not to do that. These are refurbished, so I kind of expected this. Still sucks. Neutral feedback by e***l During past 6 months Good Business Neutral feedback by 4***g During past 6 months The left ear won't hold a charge Neutral feedback by a***b During past 6 months I ordered 2 pairs of these earbuds. One mint and 1 deep red. The mint pair works perfectly fine, but the deep red pair the right earbud hardly charges and dies after about 15 ~ 20 minutes of use.
