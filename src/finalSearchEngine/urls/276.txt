But I would put a fan near the thing just in case, pun intended. I have one in my laptop but it is able to takes care of itself. Needs to be made of metal to help as a heatsink. The plastic casing isn't bad though. I got the metal version from Amazon wile my brother got the plastic one from eBay. Both perform the same and work well.

(0) (0) by mortree Aug 25, 2021 Top critical review Cheap, max SATA III speed, but very hot at idle Like most if not all current 3D SSDs it runs as fast as SATA III can handle...and unfortunately it runs pretty hot as well (40C) whether in use or not. Its cost is superb compared to prior SSD technology. But the temperature/thermal footprint is questionable for devices limited by SATA III speed interface. The prevalence of old motherboards relying solely on SATA interfaces are the sole reason to choose a 3D SATA device over NVMe interface option. But really the thermal price is probably really only appropriate for NVMe interface and speeds. I suspect we will see generational improvements in this technology for thermal performance under both load and unloaded conditions. Whether we will continue to see it used in SATA interface applications remains to be seen as motherboards with NVMe interfaces become cheaper and more common and pure SATA motherboards become more and more obsolete.
