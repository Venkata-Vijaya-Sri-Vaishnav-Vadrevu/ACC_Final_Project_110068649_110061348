Feedback on redpocketstore from others who bought this item 1078 Positive 14 Neutral 19 Negative Positive feedback by 8***1 During past month Fast Delivery! Positive feedback by 9***2 During past month great Positive feedback by s***l During past month Thanks for the quick delivery Positive feedback by t***d During past month Item as described, had to contact RedPocket for activation code. Positive feedback by p***c During past month GREAT DEAL, Thanks Positive feedback by t***d During past month Perfect, everything worked well. Thanks. A++ Seller. Positive feedback by o***t During past month Amazing....Red Pocket rocks my socks! Had Mint previously and it was a grease fire. Living the dream now! Positive feedback by b***t During past month Awesome!!! Positive feedback by 0***v During past month thanks Positive feedback by u***m During past month Please send me a code. I do not need a physical sim card. Thanks. Negative feedback by f***i During past month Activation codes were not included. Neutral feedback by b***i During past month I am happy with the service but the communication for activation isn't great. They FedEx a slip of paper that is general information and no instructions. An activation code follows several days later. Why waste money on the mailing? Just get the email out sooner. Neutral feedback by 7***x During past month It took 2 weeks to get this. No update no communication. Negative feedback by z***a During past 6 months CDMA DOES NOT WORK ON 5G PHONES (Oct 2021)! In the description it does not mention anywhere CDMA does not work on 5G phones. So, after getting my iphone 13, no service! I had to spend a few hours with online support, got a new GSMA SIM at Target, to switch to the GSMA network. Luckily GSMA coverage in my area is good and I am not travelling currently. If you are in an area only has CDMA coverage, you are screwed! Neutral feedback by 1***z During past 6 months Texting images do not work. Tried troubleshooting with various devices. So of you like texting pics / images this is not a good option. Signals drop at some places Neutral feedback by e***f During past 6 months When you apply the refill you lose any remaining days, so to save money you have to wait until the last minute to add your refill. Neutral feedback by i***e During past 6 months As described on Ebay they DID NOT send the codes to add on the minutes. Even after waiting for a week, no. I had to email them multiple time & make a phone call to speak to the customer service, and they will get it to work for you. Just make sure you know this prior to making a change. Otherwise, if you plan to transfer from other companies, you will be out of service for a while. Negative feedback by 0***- During past 6 months I’m still waiting for the code! It has been 2 months since my order was delivered but no code was provided!!!! Negative feedback by m***l During past 6 months GSMA data service has been broken for a month and RP can't fix it. Bad support with long hold times, endless back and forth on email. Nothing but problems with this service including call forwarding trouble. I don't this company will be in business by the time my prepaid term is over. I recommend you avoid this virtual carrier... since they don't own any networks, they can't fix problems and generally don't know what they're doing. Neutral feedback by a***9 During past 6 months I need 2sim cards. so i ordered 2. One for my husband, one for me. But only one sim has delivered last week. My sim is 60$. But until now the another $240 sim card has NOT delivered yet. PLEASE send me an email if there's any updates. Negative feedback by g***e During past 6 months Had no Internet/data access - Customer Service told me there is a problem with the GSMA network and to just be patient and wait until problem is resolved. However, the real problem when you renew is that settings somehow get changed, and you have no Internet/data access. You must have Technical Support fix. Customer Service continues to give wrong information because they are ignorant of the true problem. Is your lost time and business worth it? You decide. Neutral feedback by o***r During past 6 months Sent defective SIM. Had to wait 4 days a for another one. Neutral feedback by r***r During past 6 months Nobody asked me my questions here. Only at their website Negative feedback by n***8 During past 6 months Not UNLIMITED! Carrier will discontinue service if they don't like how much you you talk on the phone. They said I should use the phone less. Not UNLIMITED! Neutral feedback by 4***6 During past 6 months seemingly good deal, not super cheap but problem is with clarity of instruction on activation. Negative feedback by 5***s During past 6 months Has to contact Seller to get them to send the Sim Card. All that came in the mail was a “Congratulations” card. Seller sent the SIM card. Process took 15-16 days. That’s too long… Negative feedback by 8***e During past 6 months RedPocket is nuts. They are advertising the plan as unlimited talk and text and every day they are stopping the service saying I am using more minutes. This is fraud. I have not seen any company which does this. I would never every buy from them again. Negative feedback by j***j During past 6 months Red Pocket must be the worst service company in all the world. They make activation extremely difficult. Negative feedback by a***- During past year I have not received my shipment. Redpocket asked me to check with ebay Neutral feedback by k***k During past year Sent me broken sim at first but send a new one free of charge.
