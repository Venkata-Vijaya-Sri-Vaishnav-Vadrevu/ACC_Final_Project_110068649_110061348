These do last as noted with 4.5 minimum hours of use out of each side and the sound quality is just as good as all the Skullcandy products I have purchased in the past. Would recommend to anyone looking for quality buds. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: riccard9112 (0) (0) Why is this review inappropriate?
