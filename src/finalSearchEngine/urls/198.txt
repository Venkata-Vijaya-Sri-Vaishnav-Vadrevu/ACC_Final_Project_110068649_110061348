Really very good for a lightweight vacuum. It's easy to use and the charge lasts long enough to clean my whole house (2200+ sq. ft.). I have arthritis in my hands and it's easy to hold. It does a very good job surface cleaning. My carpet is thick, and my old Hoover left the carpet fluffed up and soft, which the Dyson is too lightweight to do. I took one star off because it does not deep clean, and also because it is ridiculously expensive for a little light cleaner The battery power is impressive and it is very nice indeed not to have to deal with a cord, so that is valuable, but for me, the battery is the stand-out feature on this machine, otherwise it's just like many other lightweight vacuums which cost hundreds less. It's good, I'm not sorry I bought it, but I think I still need a sturdier machine to properly clean the thick carpet.

As soon as I plus it in, a few hours past and the light turns red. Red signifies that there is a fault with the product itself. This is extremely disappointing considering its brand new, I just opened it from the box to use it for the first time and it's already damaged. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: swap_2011 (16) (13) by omacht Oct 31, 2017 Great product, effective, handy, compact. Dyson Animal I bought a factory refurbished unit, it is supported by Dyson, I hear their warranty is really good (a friend said they don't ask questions, they just replace it, but I have no first hand confirmation). The suction is good. The instructions on routing the power cable into the wall plate dock aren't very clear, but once you put 2 screws into your wall to support it, you plug it in, mount the base into the dock and it takes maybe 4-5 hours to charge up. There are more attachments than you are likely to need. Very handy for the car, carpets, dog bed, etc. This product picks up dog hair no problem. I am sure there will be complaints about the size of the catch basin for the dirt, but the objective is to be quick and nimble here. You cant have a big dust bin, make it light and small, so be prepared to empty the container often. The emptying is super quick just click click. Now seeing the amount of dirt you pick up in one pass is pretty gross, but remember you are seeing your dirt now, so you really know how dirty your house is. It's simply creating more awareness, of course your house is no dirtier than when you had a Cannister or Bag vacuum. The battery is 40 min on low settings, if you really max it out, you get maybe 10 min which is enough time to get the worst of it. This machine is well made, well planned, and you can always buy another battery I guess, if you have a big house. This is meant as a nimble vacuum to clean up quickly, great if you have a dog. I really like there are 2 filters that can be cleaned with water and wrung out. Nothing worse than buying a product and then getting sucked into ongoing purchases of 'special' filters (eg your fridge water filter) so that's really nice. I'm curious how long the battery lasts but I'm quite confident that if Mr Dyson can be planning to launch electric cars, he will have looked into using the best battery technology available, and I love lithium batteries for lightness and charging cycles, they are great. All in all , I can find no complaints with this product yet, especially for the price I paid on Amazon. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: dysonoutlet (3) (0) by kabaion_0 May 29, 2018 My new favorite vacuume I love this vacuume !! It works amazingly I use it to vacuum all of my area rugs throw rugs and my floors for such a small vacuum it packs a lot of power you wouldn't think that it would but it does and it's two different settings and when you put it on the highest setting it even sucks the dust out of the rug!! that's incredible I also love the tools that come with it because I can vacuum the cobwebs off my high ceilings and I can clean my ceiling fans easily now. I really am so happy that I got this because I was struggling before trying to find a good one. with an animal and two children there is always something on the floor, weather there be cookie crumbs,cereal or cat hair this vacuum just picks it all up and it makes everything look brand new again! I highly advise you to purchases this vacuume. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: dysonoutlet (4) (0) by consgor25 May 18, 2020 Love it, but... I have the big, corded Dyson and love it, but it can be difficult to use in crowded spaces and corners. The cordless version is perfect for that as well as quick clean-ups in the kitchen or car. My only complaint is that it's extremely difficult to empty the dust bin. Since everything about Dyson design is generally simple and easy to use, I wonder if this was something that went wrong when it was refurbished?
