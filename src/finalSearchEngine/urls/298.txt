I use to have the Black & Decker work stand and the Worx Pegasus surpasses all. This was the best investment I have ever made to make work easier. The stand has many more features and uses. It is the right height, excellent table area, and very portable. My work projects have been great. I have utilized most of the features of this stand and it always keeps impressing me on how well it was designed. Clamping projects come in very handy, too! X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: worxgt (8) (2) by asif2027 Dec 26, 2017 Top critical review Clamps are worthless The clamps on this table are absolutely worthless. They do not offer enough clamping pressure to perform common tasks like sawing, driving, or gluing. If you apply too much pressure, the locking mechanism "slips" and the clamp loses pressure. It is also difficult, if not impossible, to use your own clamps on the table, as the underside of the table does not have any flat surface for other clamps to hold on to, as the underside is "waffled" plastic. The table itself is certainly lightweight and easy to move around, but it is not flat across the center. Each side of the table drops slightly after you lock it in place, which means if you lay a board across the table, it rocks up and down. The only thing this table is good for is to put stuff on it. If you are looking for a good clamping table, this won't cut it. If you are looking for a sawing table, this won't cut it. If you are looking for something to put some flowers on, this should work just fine. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: worxgt (35) (8) by tantien1516 Apr 30, 2019 Fantastic product, worth the money. Strong,sturdy, solid and well built. Just started to use it and already has been a success. Some one stated that the two hand vices don't hold anything, but I used them to hold a piece of wood and it stayed right where I wanted it. They may have to get a pair of stronger hands. When I locked them down the piece of wood didn't move and wouldn't lift up. They gripped just fine. There is minimal play in how they lock into the unit (table), but that is acceptable. Strong enough to hold my portable table saw and chop saw. Used it to help support wood that I was pulling out nails out of and even banged smaller nails out and no damage to the unit. Very satisfied. Thinking about getting three more to make a larger unit.

It’s size is perfect for a small workshop. It’s very sturdy yet it’s remarkably lightweight and has all the features you’d need as a novice or intermediate mechanic. The price was a special buy and couldn’t be beat. Highly recommend.

I decided to buy the Worx WX051 Pegasus after I watched several videos on YouTube. As soon as I received the pachkage, I opned it. Within 10 seconds, I had the work table ready to go. I tested the reliability by climbing on it and walking around. I am 195 pounds and it held my weight with no problems. I am very happy with this purchance. I plan on buying second Pegasus to expand my working surface. Thank you for such a useful work table for home users and professional alike. I highly recommend this product!
