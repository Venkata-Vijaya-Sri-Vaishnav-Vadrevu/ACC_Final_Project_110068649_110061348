The sound it's great, the wireless speaker are easy to connect and link and it has a good design. Easy BT connection. But, the bass it's not too high and Bluetooth connection is poor because if you move a few steps, it's disconnected or X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: hypermicrosystems (0) (0) by pashar_8177 Nov 15, 2021 Top critical review Sound bar was not working properly I had the soundbar hooked it up to my arc HDMI port and It playedd for about an hour then the sound started cutting in and out .. it turns off when it wants to .. I have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to turn on..... I had to get extra insurance added to the soundbar cuz the insurance on the soundbar was already up I spent many hours on the phone with the technicians of Samsung running technician support had a very rough time I still got a package the soundbar up and send it back to Samsung X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: hypermicrosystems (0) (0) by abt726 Aug 09, 2021 Powerful sound! Great sound! I'm hearing things in movies I've never heard on previous watches. The DTS Virtual-X is a useful feature as it provides 3D object based sound. Super easy setup, worked right out of the box and I highly recommend it! X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: hypermicrosystems (17) (0) by lep1customs Nov 02, 2021 If it arrives undamaged from the carrier, it is a great value We have the Samsung/Harmon Kardon Q90 in our family room and the Samsung Q67CT in our master bedroom. Keep in mind 2 different size rooms in sq ft and openness,but they both sound equally good in their location. We did not play them side by side, but the Q67CT did not disappoint. We have NOT experienced ANY dropout issues that we have seen in other reviews. For the price, we are extremely pleased.

I thought it had a pass thru mode when the unit was off, but it doesn't seem to work that way. I now have to use 3 remotes to watch tv.
