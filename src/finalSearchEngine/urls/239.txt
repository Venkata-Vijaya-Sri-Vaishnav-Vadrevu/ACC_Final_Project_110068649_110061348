I am surprised at the quality for the price. Sure, the native resolution is low and it needs to be in a dark room to see it clearly, but it was practically free. If you think you are going to watch HD movies on this thing and be happy, you will be disappointed, but for the right purposes it is very neat (and again, practically free). I've been using it to project ambient render videos onto the wall and routing the audio to my surround sound - almost like adding a huge window where I can select the weather. It is also handy as an extra PC screen in a dark room. The only problem I have had with the thing is that it can't rotate the image 90 degrees for a portrait orientation from the device - it needs to be done on the input side and not all input devices can do that either (thanks, Chromecast...). It does allow you to flip the image in a variety of landscape modes and that adds some flexibility and it also allows you to force 4:3 aspect (effectively shrinking the size of a 16:9 signal). Overall this is an excellent value, but don't have unrealistic expectations. A good quality projector will set you back a thousand dollars or more - this thing is practically free. It far exceeds my expectations for the price point.

Not enough lumens The image quality is good at a couple of feet away from the projector. After that it is very weak.This is not a 2000 lumens projector. It is 20 lumens. That is very weak. .For my use...that of projecting woodworking images to enlarge them to make patterns it is ok if I keet the projected image close to the projector.

Apr 28, 2020 Good stuff It's affordable, the picture is good, comes with sound, if you don't have speakers it's nice to have, very light and easy to set up. Easy to use, I have my Xbox 1 and a flashdrive installed, the only thing I would change is the auxillary settings or add audio plug-in, so I wouldn't need a receiver to upgrade the sound, nothing a $5 cord can't fix though, great product great price 150 inches of awesome, I have mine projecting onto a regular wall, and hooked it up to the curling with a couple things I had laying around X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: shutshop (18) (1) by d.riv-17 May 30, 2020 Great product This product was great for the money. It has good quality picture and easy to use. The sound quality isn’t the best on the integrated speaker but it has an easy connection to hook up an outside speaker. All in all, great product. Highly recommended.
