We make it easyLearn more Create a great listing Here’s five ways to set yourself up for success. Write a standout title We’ll recommend search terms that buyers often use, so be sure to add these in the title. Avoid all caps and focus on specific details like brand, model, size, and color. Take high-quality photos Snap your items from multiple angles in a well-lit place, and capture any blemishes for transparency. On the eBay app, you can clean up your images and add a white background. Pick a purchase format If you want to sell your item quickly, Buy it Now is probably the best format for you. Otherwise, if you want to try your luck and shoot for the best possible price, choose Auction. Set the right price We will recommend a price based on recent sales of similar items. You can even watch how other sellers are pricing their items, or use Best Offer to negotiate and sell faster. Ship with ease We provide recommendations for delivery, but to save on shipping, use an eBay delivery label. Plus, if you’re selling locally, you can also offer Local Pickup. FAQ How much does it cost to sell? Once your item sells, we generally charge 10-15% of the final value. Your first 250 listings each month are free and, after, there’s a $0.35 insertion fee per listing.

How should I choose my listing price? For most items, we can provide a price recommendation for you based on recently sold, similar items.
