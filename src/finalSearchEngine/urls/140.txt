Positive feedback by e***e During past month Fast Delivery. good service. recommended. Positive feedback by f***o During past month Product as described, No issues, Thank you! Positive feedback by -***t During past month Fast and Responsive. Took real good care of me. Positive feedback by o***u During past month Seller responded in less than 24 hours (on a weekend), when I emailed about an issue. Thank you Redpocket! Positive feedback by i***t During past month Wonderful cusomer service. Thank you. Positive feedback by i***t During past month Thank you. Positive feedback by 7***e During past month A+ Great seller Negative feedback by k***g During past month Called redpocket, provided my IMEI, was told CDMA card was compatible. Ordered the sim card, and then it won't activate. They told me they are getting an error to activate it and to try a different technology. Brand new unlocked pixel 6.. It is compatible on all networks. Negative feedback by d***j During past month well their 3 day free shipping was free but it took 6 days to get to me. I had all kinds of troubles getting my unlocked phone to work with this sim. after 4 days on the phone with red Pocket and my old carrier and my new phone store I was ready to throw in the towel. but somehow it started working after I had manually configured my phone. all Red Pocket could tell me is my phone was locked. Bullchit I had to wait about 2 hours for my phone to get activated after I manually configured it. Negative feedback by d***o During past 6 months The worst service one can experience. I am going to request for refund. Negative feedback by o***o During past 6 months USPS does not seem to be able to deliver anything on time, or even deliver period!! Neutral feedback by 1***z During past 6 months Please note that text messaging does not work with images or pics using redpocket gsma sim. Also please note that red pocket texting has 600kb limit on text image size which is really small size. But mine does not work even with smaller 200kb size image . Phone signal can drop at certain places . So the price is good but not the quality. Neutral feedback by n***u During past 6 months Everything is working except the data! Neutral feedback by e***r During past 6 months Had to wait a day or two to get the codes. Should be automatic as soon as making the purchase. Then took 2-3 hours on the phone w/ customer support to get our phones working. Both accounts got set up incorrectly initially. Neutral feedback by i***f During past 6 months took a while to receive activation code, or even a response. Great price though Negative feedback by c***r During past 6 months BUYER BEWARE! 90-Day terms buried in the listing. If you don't use your prepaid within that time you lose it. Wasted $100 bucks. Neutral feedback by t***1 During past 6 months I did not receive anything but an advertisement that was delivered and had a tracking number. I had to call to get my PIN sent to me via email. However, I am happy with Red Pocket Cell service and price. Negative feedback by a***o During past 6 months Paid for 360 day service, got 330 day. Be careful when you apply your refill. If you refill before the last day of service they shortchange you. Horrible and unethical practice. Neutral feedback by 5***s During past 6 months I have bought 5 1yr plans in the last 90 days. I have 2 message the seller 2 get my PIN number each time when it should be emailed or mailed 2 me. Makes no sense. Don’t get me wrong, The service is wonderful!!!! Price is Good!!!! But the Customer experience after ur intitial purchase is something 2 be desired. Neutral feedback by s***- During past 6 months great deal but not well explained; hint: the email immediately after the order is where your annual service credit is stored for activation. Not the stuff in the mail. Neutral feedback by n***a During past 6 months Needed to call, chat or message them to get my codes, that I already paid for. Not a good experience. Neutral feedback by d***e During past 6 months Seller sent an invalid activation code first. I had to contact seller to get it corrected Negative feedback by z***z During past 6 months Customer service is very poor if you need it. Bought this card and a week later we still cant make a call or text and they refuse to refund my money. I'd leave less than one star if I could. Negative feedback by a***m During past 6 months Got an envelope in the mail a week after ordering with only a sales flyer in it, no activation code! Had to contact customer service to get it resolved. Also read the fine print, no refunds and no switching plans without losing your money and starting over. They are completely inflexible with their policies. Negative feedback by i***- During past 6 months Sent me an advertising paper by mail. No PIN code for what I paid for. Have to message the seller asking for a PIN code to refill my phone. 4 days waiting just for the code. The seller really doesn't know how to do business and takes it seriously. Look like kids playing around. Unbelievable, Neutral feedback by i***n During past 6 months Received Quickly. Will Never Purchase Again because it immediately steals all the data included in this plan! Negative feedback by o***1 During past year Terrible phone service! Returned item, but return address was forwarded! Had to get eBay to refund.
