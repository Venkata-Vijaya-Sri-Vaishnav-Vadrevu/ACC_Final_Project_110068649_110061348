Packaged carefully, and smaller than most Invicta Watches. That’s exactly what I wanted. It fits me better than others, because of the smaller size. Perfect. Thanks. X Previous image Next image (4) (0) by mikey3424 Apr 01, 2020 Top critical review Don't waste your money I have several Invicta watches and this one really looks cheap next to the others. Looks like some cheap piece of junk you would buy at a swap meet. Even the box doesn't compare to other Invicta boxes I have. Just the watch around a pillow thrown in a yellow box wth the Invicta name on it. The size of the watch loos more like it's made for a ladies wrist rather than a mans, and I have a small wrist. I'll be selling this at my next yard sale for sure. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: mygiftstop (0) (5) by janeylou0 Jun 25, 2019 Fabulous watch for no money!! This watch is fitted with a very good Japanese automatic movement by all accounts, so the timekeeping is very good. The power reserve on my watch, once fully "wound" by movement or the actual winding mechanism, is over two days. That's amazing in itself. It has a nice easy to read date due to the "fish eye" feature at the three o'clock setting which magnifies the numbers really well. It's a good weight and has a good solid, simple design, not flashy but it still gets admiring glances when in company. You can even get an extended warranty by filling in a few forms and forwarding them on to Invicta. It's also a really good price compared to similar quality watches so it's an easy choice. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: mygiftstop (6) (0) by iron_maiden9870 Jan 12, 2019 A great watch that should be unisex. I have to say I am very happy with my watch. Its perfect for my small wrist and I recommend it for man who has smaller wrist. In my opininion this watch can also be used by women. It has that unisex style and his small size would be perfect on a womens wrist. The size of the watch can be adjusted. This is a very good watch and the price is very affordable.

Well made and rugged. Nicely styled with classic looks. I'm currently using one that is over 8 years old and it still looks great and works well. For the modest price, you can't go wrong with this watch! I like to keep a few on hand as backups.
