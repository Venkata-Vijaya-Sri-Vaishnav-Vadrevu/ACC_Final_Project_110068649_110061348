Feedback on harmanaudio from others who bought this item 998 Positive 1 Neutral 11 Negative Positive feedback by 6***o During past month Exactly as described, works perfectly! Thank you! Positive feedback by a***p During past month Thanks very much Positive feedback by e***h During past month Quick delivery **thumbs up** Positive feedback by e***3 During past month Exactly as advertised and good shipping time. Thank you! Excellent product, good price. Thank you! Positive feedback by 8***r During past month Thanks Positive feedback by 9***s During past month Everything was fine. Price, product, and service. Positive feedback by k***o During past month Super fast shipping A+. Nice quality Positive feedback by 5***y During past month Excellent seller. Positive feedback by o***4 During past month nice Positive feedback by h***h During past month happy with purchase would buy from again Negative feedback by d***2 During past month The head phones didn’t work and they are terrible wouldn’t buy Neutral feedback by i***i During past month Headphones came quickly but they are just horrible. I can't believe anyone rated these positively. If you are only looking to use them for meetings... Well good luck with that because it would not stay connected to my device via Bluetooth. And the sound quality is just the worst for music. Negative feedback by d***d During past month Great Negative feedback by -***- During past month Purchased item by accident immediately messaged to cancel order. 2+ days I’m ignored after several requests and seller just ships and says to late to cancel!! That’s TERRIBLE customer service and I will NEVER deal with crooks like this again! Negative feedback by y***y During past month did not recieved my product Negative feedback by u***0 During past month these headphones do NOT sound authentic. And now I have to pay my own shipment back Negative feedback by q***z During past month The JBL LIVE 500BTs seemed to be fresh and new at first, however after taking my first walk outside with them, I immediately heard a loud creaking sound by the right earcup. They could've been made with old parts or poorly assembled, but this noise is awful because it can't get covered by noise cancelling and I have to hear this creaking, clicking sound nearly every time I turn my head or walk, caused by shifting the earcup by only the slightest bit. I'll update this if it gets resolved. Negative feedback by u***a During past month seller didnt let me return only 2 minutes after buying item. literally not even shipped Negative feedback by r***r During past month 150% markup from retail stores. Raised prices to put fake Black Friday discount, still over prove in regular store. Get the newer version cheaper without having to wait on shipping Negative feedback by e***j During past month Only 1 side worked, I was so excited to finnaly get this and for it be only 1 side coming out with sound, I’ve checked my settings to see if it’s Accidentally set to one ear but isn’t Negative feedback by 7***6 During past month I cancelled literally one minute after ordering because it was the wrong model and these guys shipped it anyways saying the package was already shipped so we can’t refund. There’s no way they shipped the item within the same minute of purchase. Either they are not prompt with checking their customers request or they ignored the cancellation and sent it on purpose after a day of ignoring the cancellation. Either way never buying from Harmon again.
