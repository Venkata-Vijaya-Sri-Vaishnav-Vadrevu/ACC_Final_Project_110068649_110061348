Seller sold item to Puerto Rico but did not provide air shipping label for returning the item because they only offer ground shipping so why are they selling items to an island?! Was assured by them that they would pay me back for my expense of air shipping label and they have ghosted me after receiving item. I have contacted eBay and submitted a report/investigation against this seller. Be aware, not a trustworthy vendor.

X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: irobot (8) (0) by tgagnier1 Jan 12, 2021 Top critical review Short battery Life! Dust bin fills up fast I recieved the iRobot refurbished roomba at the beginning of the year. Spec is 90 minutes run time. The bast run time I have recorded is 43 minutes on a replacement battery under warranty. The collection bin fills up very fast (my dog has long hair) once the bin is full It keeps running and leaves the remaining dog hair in rolled up clumps that it can't pickup once the bin is emptied. So I have to use a bristol brush vacuum to pickup the clumps of hair.i did have a 650 series and it was a much better vacuum. Run time was 90 minutes. The brush was always needing to be cleaned of dog hair (more maintenance but still did a better job than the E6.97 X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: irobot (15) (0) by tcaphou Nov 02, 2021 Easy to use Love this thing. Best part is the feature that it works autonomously. Once it뭩 finished, it returns to it뭩 base to recharge. Awesome. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: irobot (1) (0) by golfr718 Feb 08, 2021 Cannot recommend this fun gadget... I love gadgets, especially when they genuinely make life more convenient. The Refurbished iRobot E6 100% satisfies my appreciation for gadgets, but unfortunately I find that the required upkeep and performance shortfalls actually consume more time than manual vacuuming. I have a fairly basic floorplan (1 Level Rancher) and our furniture is arranged with plenty of space for the iRobot to operate without too many obstacles. However, in the 5 weeks I've had the E6 in use it has consistently fallen short of expectations for 4 main reasons. 1) It ALWAYS leaves a trail of clumped-up dog hair. 2) It regularly gets stuck on the legs of 2 of our charis. 3) It does not do a good job of handling our heirloom oriental rugs, and I'm always worried that it will damage the corners of the rugs (much more so than our upright vacuum). 4) Within 5 weeks of daily use the E6 began getting "Error 2" indicating that the main brushes need clearing. Despite following iRobot's cleaning instructions the issue will no clear, and the vacuum will not run while the faulty error remains. I have filed a warranty claim to hopefully fix the issue, but it should not be a problem after only 5 weeks. Overall, I cannot recommend the iRobot E6 because the performance is lacking and upkeep/maintenance is ar more labor intensive than with a traditional vacuum. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: No (13) (0) by timon_11 Jul 12, 2021 Work Saver You asked do I like my new Roomba. Heck NO I don't like my Roomba, I love it. I have been watching as it learns it's way around. It actually goes under the tables and between the chair ,legs. I don't move around so well anymore so this is a blessing. My carpets and floor are cleaner than they have been for months. This is not some toy, this is some high-tech. If you are not comfortable using your phone app, this probably isn't for you. I know a lot of seniors out there don't like the new tech. I'm not one of them. The only issue I have is remembering that it needs to be emptied and the filter need to be cleaned regularly. If you are thinking about one of these and you are OK with smartphone apps, stop thinking and get one. You won't be sorry. No more pushing that beast of a vacuum around anymore, just tell Roomba to do it for you and it's done.
