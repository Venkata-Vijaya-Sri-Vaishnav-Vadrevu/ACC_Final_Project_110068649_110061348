Positive feedback by a***4 During past month Great seller. Highly recommended. Positive feedback by i***j During past month Very professional packaging, very fast delivery and great price. Would recommend this seller A++ Positive feedback by r***k During past month I purchased Ryzen CPU from them before. I trust seller. Good product at good prices. Positive feedback by d***s During past month fast shipping, they're legit, it's good to be an ant! Positive feedback by 2***z During past month On time, packaged perfectly Positive feedback by d***a During past month Antonline is amazing! They are very willing to work with and help you with any needs or concerns. I had to cancel my purchase, and they were very willing to work with me on that. You won't regret buying from them! Positive feedback by e***k During past month Outstanding, this is the best service possible! I will be doing business with these people in the future. Fair price and excellent service is truly noted! Positive feedback by 7***w During past month A+ Quick shipping Positive feedback by a***t During past month Very quick shipping, authentic CPU that arrived as described. Thank you! Neutral feedback by 6***a During past 6 months The box was damaged and it looked like there was some thermal past on the cpu. That said, the cpu was a Beast! Clocks high and performs well. Negative feedback by a***2 During past 6 months Received a box with packing materials and no cpu. Antonline never communicated with me and I had to escalate to eBay. Negative feedback by 0***e During past 6 months Poor communication, two messages sent but no response. Negative feedback by 0***m During past year Packaging was absolutely horrible. They shipped a 600$ CPU in nothing more then it뭩 manufactured, along with a cardboard box double the size of the original box. This gave the original box the ability to simply be thrown around the much larger box. A simple inclusion of $.50 worth of packing peanuts would of made an amazing difference.

I am a little biased because I was able to get a really good price but this chip blows the i7-6700k I've been using for 5 years away. It may even be overkill considering it's just for gaming. I maybe could have gone with the 5600x but I wanted to future proof a little more. It clocked up to 4850mhz out of the box and it does 5.0 all cores at about 70 degrees C with a Kraken Z73. I have been solidly impressed with the performance so far. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: ohenr-93 (14) (0) by jeremiaedward-5 Sep 15, 2021 Great Purchase Great CPU performance, solid product as usual from AMD. Maintains advertised boost clocks well. Only qualm is that it runs hot, regardless of the cooler used. Will shoot right up to 80C+ under moderate to heavy loads under water cooling or large air tower. Radiator / heatsink does not get that warm which tells me the heat can't dissipate from the CPU itself / integrated heat spreader fast enough, so not sure any amount of cooling will alleviate that problem. Have tried remounting coolers, but enough people report this despite having excellent cooling that I believe it's inherent to the CPU design. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: antonline (5) (1) by robergal Jan 12, 2021 WOW sums it up nicely. Actually 3.8 Ghz not 3.7 and it clocked to 4.9 Ghz out of the box. Amd promised 4.7 so... If I had to do it again I would. This is a very fast very stable processor. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: 401gator (27) (0) by jennbren1975 Oct 04, 2021 Awesome CPU! Great CPU. Was concerned about temperature as this CPU is reported as running hot. I have a decent air cooler mounted with a push pull 120mm fan set up and had no issues with CPU heat. Would recommend this CPU to anyone looking for a great performance AMD processor. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: antonline (0) (0) by jj61_59 Jun 29, 2021 Tune it and Go!! This CPU the 5800x at this price level of below $400 is the best processor in the world!! No lie, this thing flies!! It does run hot but with the combination of the curve optimizer and Ryzen Tuner! You can tune it to your liking! And after tuning mines it is at the top of the CPU-Z benchmark!! It's an upgrade over my Ryzen 5 3600, and I can tell a big difference. Everything is smoother and quicker than before! Now the only bottleneck in my system is the slow 2tb hard disk drive! Which no processor can make run faster! Smh.
