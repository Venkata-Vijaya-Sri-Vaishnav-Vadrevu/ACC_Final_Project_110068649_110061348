The overall quality is very good and meets my needs. The sound is good and the ear buds are very comfortable. Pairing the ear buds to my phone was very easy and charge time was surprisingly fast. Solo ear bud use is easy to use and the ear buds offer a wide number of touch controls. For the money I paid I found the "Skullcandy Indy Fuel True Wireless Ear Buds" to be a high value. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: rjjewelry4 (42) (0) by whendry Oct 24, 2021 Top critical review Not a deal if they don't work right Never owned a Skullcandy product but this product has to be inferior to the ones that established their reputation as a quality product. A lot of reviews mention the lack of bass that SK is known for. I purchased this product thinking I would get a high quality product without a lot of bass, which I didn't want anyway. But what I received was far from quality. The bluetooth range is severely limited. Often all I have to do is turn my head and one of the buds disconnects, even though the phone is in my hand . The volume response is less than other bud brands I own and limits my ability to listen to podcasts recorded at low volume. The touch controls leave a lot to be desired. I thought it was just my learning curve til I went back to using another pair of non-name-brand buds that are much easier to control. Although these buds connect to my Android phone, they can only be relied on to connect to audio, not .phone. Not sure what 'refurbished' means but these issues are likely the reason this pair were returned in the first place. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: greatvaluesite (3) (2) by jdelvin Oct 05, 2021 Some good, some bad Featured and quality are great. The sound is lacking bass, and it also took me 4 times at resetting them to pair with my phone, which is a newer mid range phone, so if you get these, don't give up at pairing them. I love the ambient feature. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: greatvaluesite (1) (0) by guiga.figueiredo Oct 19, 2021 A lot of potential, but something went wrong. The good: Sound is very good. It is lightweight, the battery last long. The not so good: The app needs a lot of work, but there is potential. The bad: the rubber keeps faling off form the earpiece, even if you snuggle the borders in, I have to fiz it everyday, more than one time. The bluetooth connection stutters and breaks quite often, unlike other bluetooth devices, even with the phone in my pocket it keeps breaking connection and back again. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: refurbished | Sold by: greatvaluesite (0) (1) by 94fordgt Oct 19, 2021 Great wireless earbuds Wireless charging works great. Sound quality is good. I still prefer my Apple ear pods, but I am more used to them. The wireless charging case is larger than the non wireless charging case on my air pods which is expected, but not as comfortable in the pocket.
