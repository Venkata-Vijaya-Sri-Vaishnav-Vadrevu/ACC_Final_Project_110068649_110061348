Negative feedback by a***y During past 6 months I received the Power washer a few weeks ago, put it together yesterday for its initial use , and the high pressure hose has 2 pinholes. Negative feedback by .***m During past 6 months Missing parts, no replacement sent, just interested in getting your email to get you on their solicitation list when they have everything they need from ebay to fix the problem! Neutral feedback by a***c During past 6 months Good Negative feedback by s***i During past 6 months Worst experience ever on eBay. Sunjoe didn’t send me a hose coupler to hook my hose to the washer (vital component of operation). Was informed that I had to “register” my product before they would replace the missing part needed to function. After going back and forth they stated that whole thing had to be returned and they would send a completely new unit. I ordered the missing piece from Amazon for $6 instead. Avoid this company at all costs, their business practices are the worst. Negative feedback by s***5 During past 6 months I've only used one time. It doesn't work now. Please help. Negative feedback by b***e During past 6 months dint work properly , i never buy anything from them anymore.. Neutral feedback by r***e During past 6 months the black nozzle is missing,....Everything else is fine. Neutral feedback by e***e During past 6 months The pressure washer was missing the Needle Clean-out tool. I call for a replacement and it has been a couple of weeks and I have not received it. I did use the pressure washer for the second time and it appears that the soap dispensers don't work. Negative feedback by t***f During past 6 months ran 30 sec pure junk crook beware Negative feedback by 1***5 During past 6 months When I received it and started to put together the o-rings on the ends of the hose where the handle attaches and the other end to the unit one end didn’t have an o-ring the other was dried out and severely cracked so I went to the local Ace Hardware to find them then put together. I pulled it. In to use and water is poring out of the unit!! I sincerely doubt this unit was remanufactured, if it was it definitely wasn’t tested !!! Sent it back and still don’t have my replacement!!!!! Neutral feedback by a***1 During past 6 months I have not been able to try the pressure washer The trigger mechanism does not fit the hose and the wond does not fit the trigger mechanism, I have an old son Joe I’m going to rob the parts off of it ! Also I called I was told I need to register it the only thing in the box was the instruction manual to assemble it ! Neutral feedback by t***v During past 6 months I received the product in great time, although there were parts missing in the package and I am unable to complete assembly and use the power washer until they send the missing parts which is taking forever. Neutral feedback by i***a During past 6 months Shipped with parts missing, customer support unavailable on weekend. When contact made, only option was to return for exchange. Neutral feedback by r***5 During past 6 months A few scruffs here and there, but it looks good for the price, fast shipping. Negative feedback by r***e During past 6 months Disappointing customer service! The pressure washer came without a spray wand - useless. I contacted them the day it was delivered, but didn't hear anything back until I emailed again the next week. I got an email with a parts order number, saying "Our promise is to get you back in action as soon as possible", but it's been over a week and I just called again and the rep said that parts orders regularly take 7-10 business days to ship. Should have said that from the beginning! Negative feedback by i***7 During past 6 months Missing parts. He said that he would get them out. But still haven't got them. Negative feedback by d***a During past 6 months It came missing four parts. It has been two weeks and they still have not sent out replacement parts. Neutral feedback by f***a During past 6 months Very poorly packaged, missing the nozzle cleaning tool, some parts dirty, but at least it works. I love Sun Joe products but won't buy refurbished again. You get what you pay for. Neutral feedback by o***. During past 6 months Not " like-new, excellent" as described. Missing parts, the water connectors have calcium building up, hose not fitted; no warranty card attached. I contacted SJ several times but and still not receive replacement parts. Neutral feedback by r***_ During past year Didn't come with the part to hook my hose to it and when the pictures show it on there when I message them it was like playing 21 questions ordered it from Amazon fast then answering all the questions but it works great See all Ratings and Reviews Write a review 4.7 348 product ratings 5 5 Stars, 282 product ratings 282 4 4 Stars, 47 product ratings 47 3 3 Stars, 6 product ratings 6 2 2 Stars, 2 product ratings 2 1 1 Stars, 11 product ratings 11 Would recommend Good value Good quality Most relevant reviews See all 288 reviews by alra195 Jul 13, 2017 Top favorable review Sun Joe SPX3000 Pretty effective little machine for light house hold chores. The range of nozzles gives plenty of power for the basic stuff around the house. Cleans truck mats, siding, gutters, etc. Soaping (low pressure) nozzle could be a bit more powerful, but it's adequate for dispensing cleaning agents from either of the two on board fluid reservoirs. That's a handy feature for going between siding and the car. The hose attachment connector that comes with the unit is pretty wimpy. It works but I'd highly recommend getting the replacement brass assembly (use two rubber hose washer on the connector and tighten completely to eliminate leakage). These are easily had at almost any decent hardware or big box store. I like that it shuts off when the handle is released (lowers energy consumption) and that it has a fairly long electrical cord. It's also very quiet to operate and pretty efficient with water usage. It's been handy to have around, it finds plenty of work!

(9) (4) by switch-blade-knife Jun 11, 2019 Sun Joe Electric Pressure Washer / 2030 PSI / 1.76 GPM / 14.5 AMP This electric pressure washer is easy to assemble and has an excellent fit and finish for the price. It also happens to work very well, which is really the whole point. I've used it to clean off polywood patio furniture and the cement on my front porch. This pressure washer did a masterful job on both. My next use will be to clean off the composite wood railings and flooring of my rear deck. Excellent performance at a very reasonable cost. I'm extremely pleased with this pressure washer. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: snowjoe_factory... (9) (0) by mirrcom May 21, 2020 Good Bye Gas Power pressure Washer! My 2000 psi Kracher only 2 years old was loosing water pressure. I spent hours replacing water pump seals. After the thing wouldn't start I followed everyone's advise about contaminates and cleaned the carburetor. Only to find out, it was the "kill switch" was bad. In the interim, I ordered the electric pressure washer not really thinking it would do the job but it was great. I cleaned my 200 ft long 6 ft cypress fence and 20ft x 20ft courtyard patio. My 4 year grandson give it a try on the fence with my close supervision. He thought it so cool to help Pop Pop. For my use, it is perfect. I purchased the rotary nozzle, but the pressure washer comes with five different sizes. Long story short, this unit has replaced my gas pressure washer. X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: elizun-33 (12) (0) by ernie-b Jul 09, 2019 Overall I like the Sun Joe Electric Pressure Washer. It was much easier to set-up than my old gas pressure washer. Received my Sun Joe Electric Pressure Washer a few weeks ago. I have been using it and like it very much. I cleaned my pool cover, and my brick walk way. The pool cover came clean and I finished the job in less time than when I used gas pressure washer before. The unit work verywell on my brick walk way. It was capable of removing any moss growing and embedded dirt. When using the Sun Joe Electric Pressure on the brick I had to be carful not to remove the polymetric sand that locked the bricks in place.
