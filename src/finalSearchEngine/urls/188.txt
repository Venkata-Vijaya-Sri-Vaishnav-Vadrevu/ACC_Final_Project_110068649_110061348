Feedback on coolbeens from others who bought this item 7 Positive 0 Neutral 1 Negative Positive feedback by n***i During past month Everything perfect. Thanks! Negative feedback by 5***a During past month It has been three weeks since I ordered the TV and it has not arrived yet. And the shipping company (team WW) still says to wait until next week. Seller should definitely change the shipping company. I cannot comment on the item as I have not seen it yet but could not wait to give this feedback. Positive feedback by b***1 During past 6 months Received TV yesterday. Up and running! AWESOME!!! Great Ebay seller! Smooth transaction!!Thanks you!!!!! Positive feedback by d***a During past 6 months Great item. . Will buy from again Awesome awesome! Fast and secure shipping. Positive feedback by l***o During past 6 months Great experience. Positive feedback by w***w During past 6 months TV was as described. Shipping was a little slow but item arrived in great condition. Positive feedback by m***n During past 6 months Tv had small imperfection in screen but not worth the hassle to return. Positive feedback by 3***3 During past 6 months The product is great and is exactly what I ordered and the seller's communication was excellent. The only negative is with the carrier used for delivery. I called them multiple times as my package was sitting at a terminal in the airport 10 minutes from me for almost 3 days before somebody actually got it. When they called me to finally deliver it they were very unprofessional and rude.

This is a really reasonable quality display with simple options that make it feel integrated into you decor like a true flush mounting even without a cutout for plugs and customizable frames. This was a refurb which wasn’t clear from the listing (Samsung won’t support it) but with the savings I was able to buy a warranty and it was still cheaper than list! X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: firstclasstvs (0) (0) by heamcb12 Oct 19, 2021 Took forever !!! This shipping situation was a complete nightmare. Trying to get a hold of whatever company they use as an absolute disaster, I had to pick it up at some sketchy warehouse in a bad part of town. And it took almost a month so if you need it immediately reconsider. Other than that the TV is fine X Previous image Next image Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: firstclasstvs (3) (0) by k.adkins Nov 08, 2021 Great Gorgeous picture. Ultra low profile.
